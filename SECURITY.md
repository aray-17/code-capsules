# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in Code Capsules,
please email **research@anindaray.com** rather than filing a public
GitHub issue. Include:

- A description of the issue and the affected component
- Steps to reproduce
- Any proof-of-concept code (please keep it minimal)

You can expect an acknowledgement within **7 days**. Please give
the maintainer reasonable time to investigate and prepare a fix
before public disclosure.

## Scope

Code Capsules is a Python framework that orchestrates calls to
third-party LLM APIs and, optionally, runs SWE-bench evaluation
inside Docker. It exposes no network listener and stores no
credentials of its own. Most vulnerability reports in this scope
will fall into one of:

- Prompt-injection paths that bypass the quality gate (repro
  verifier) or the cost governor
- Resource exhaustion (token or memory abuse) in the controller
  or escalation loop
- Issues in the optional Docker SWE-bench evaluation path

Issues in upstream LLM providers, in the SWE-bench harness itself,
in user code that calls the framework, or in deployments that
expose the framework over a network are out of scope for this
policy and should be reported to the relevant party.
